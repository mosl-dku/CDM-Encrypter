README for dek_keygen & CDM-Encrypter

	dek_gen (data encryption key) 
	run dek_gen.sh to generate DEK
		datafile --> Hd
		codehash --> Hc
		extend Hd with Hc, sha256(Hd || Hc)
	pick the DEK and run CDM-Encrypter with DEK
	
	CDM-Encrypter
		run with key_path_dir , DEK, input_file, output_file
		key_path_dir includes private.key (private key), public.crt (certificate)
		DEK from dek_gen
		input_file is the source CDM csv file
		output_file is the encrypted file

	After the encryption, 
		it will generates enc_key, output_file
			enc_key is the encrypted DEK
			output_file is the encrypted data
